## "Feed Reader - testing".
It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

This project is last one of six projects to be performed during the course Front End Nanodegree provided by Udacity.com. (This course prepares the student to a level of Front End (junior) Developer)

### The goal of this project.
The purpose of this project was to prepare tests for correct operation of the various elements of the application using 'Jasmine' the behavior-driven development framework.

## What I learned?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. Tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
